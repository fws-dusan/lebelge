### Why Do You Need a website file integrity monitoring plugin?

No single WordPress security solution is bullet proof. Every solution has its shortcomings. A complete security solution is made up of a suite of tools and plugins that work together, allowing you to address all of your website's security requirements. The more tools and security layers you build, the harder it will be for attackers to succeed. It also makes it easier for you to block malicious attacks, and monitor the site's security and health.

The Website File Changes Monitor plugin provides you with the much needed visibility of modifications that happen on your website's file system. File changes on your WordPress website can be an early sign of a malicious hack attack or a technical problem. Hence why security professionals recommend a website files monitor plugin.

The Website File Changes Monitor plugin helps you:

* Identify a possible hack attack during the early stages, allowing you to limit the damage
* Find where exactly backdoors, trojans and other malware are injected on your site
* Identify the infections and code changes during the post-hack forensics & cleanup
* Catch red-handed the exploitation of 0-day vulnerabilities on your site
* Ease the process of cleaning & recovering an infected hacked website

#### A Role Beyond WordPress Security

The scope of monitoring your website for file changes goes beyond detecting malicious attacks and malware infections. It is a WordPress website security and management best practice that can also help you:

* Check  the integrity of your WordPress core, plugins and theme files
* Find leftover files developers leave by mistake that could lead to sensitive information disclosure, such as backup files, database files etc
* Keep track of where developers are doing code changes on your WordPress site
* Troubleshoot and avoid unnecessary technical WordPress site problems

### Website File Changes Monitor Plugin Features

Website File Changes Monitor is a very easy to use and zero admin plugin. Once installed it automatically starts scanning all the files on your WordPress site without requiring any manual intervention.

However don’t let the simplicity and automation fool you. Under the hood the Website File Changes Monitor plugin is a fully blown and configurable tool that every WordPress site administrator should install on their WordPress sites and multisite network.

#### Instant Email Notifications

After a scan, the Website File Changes Monitor plugin sends an email with the list of file changes it identifies on your WordPress sites and multisite networks.

The email includes all the details you require to keep tabs of the file changes on your website, such as:
* The filename and the path of the file
* A count of how many files were added, modified or deleted
* A highlight of the site admin changes that caused the file changes, such as the plugins or themes installs, uninstalls and updates.

#### No False Alarms - Just Genuine Alerts!

The Website File Changes Monitor plugin uses an exclusive smart technology that detects WordPress core updates, plugins and themes installs, uninstalls and updates.

When you update the WordPress core, install a new plugin, update a theme, or delete a plugin it won’t flood you with hundreds of alerts prompting a false alarm! You only get alerted of genuine file changes that can have an effect on the functionality and security of your WordPress site!

#### Scans ALL Your Files, Including Custom Code

The Website File Changes Monitor plugin can scan any type of file and it is not limited to WordPress and PHP files. Apart from the WordPress core files, plugins and themes files, it will also scan any other custom code files that you might have on your WordPress site. 

It also compares the WordPress core files of your website to the list of files on the official WordPress repository, so it will also alert you if a WordPress core file has been tampered with, or changed.
