Stop Shipping to PO Boxes

Please contact us at support@majemedia.com or go to [https://www.majemedia.com](https://majemedia.com/plugins/no-po-boxes) for plugin support.

Restricts the WooCommerce checkout form for allowing PO Boxes for shipping addresses.

- If same billing/shipping address the customer cannot complete checkout with a PO Box as a billing/shipping address.
- If the customer is shipping to a different physical address they cannot use a PO Box as a shipping address, but can use it as a billing address.
- Does not restrict the use of PO Boxes on Digital/Virtual only carts.
- Requires that WooCommerce shipping is enabled.
- Requires that WooCommerce has a shipping method setup (can be free shipping only).
